Game is still in a work in progress so here are things to know
--Default Controles -> Left,Right,Down,Up Arrows to move  |  Enter to interacts  |  esc = back/cancle |
        FrontEnd/Window -> Method -> warmUpKeyListener <- (near the bottom)   for available keys
                            OR
        BackEnd/FileManagment/SavedData/Settings/KeyBindings for more info    for what keys do what

--Texture/Colors are still a work in progress


---Over world

---internal
In order to save you need to change the boolean variable "deleteFilesOnStart" inside of "FrontEnd/Runner" line 39~ (could break game tho idk

-Settings
the only option that work are the save and keybinding feature works
