---HOW TO PLAY---
-Default Controles -> Left,Right,Down,Up Arrows to move  |  Enter to interacts  |  esc = back/cancle | Rest are self explaintory (in game) |

---File Locations---
-for available keys   : FrontEnd/Window -> Method -> warmUpKeyListener <- (near the bottom)   
-for what keys do what: BackEnd/FileManagment/SavedData/Settings/KeyBindings for more info   

---Things to Know---
-Texture/Colors are still a work in progress
-the only option that work are the save and keybinding feature works

---Debugger/Code Workings---
-In order to save you need to change the boolean variable "deleteFilesOnStart" inside of "FrontEnd/Runner" line 39~ (could break game tho idk)
